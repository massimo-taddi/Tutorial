x = 3.14
#we created a value type float
x1=1

#type int

#as provided by the example 
#the syntax for a variable in phyton
#is not defined before we define the variable
#but is defined by the type of value we put
#in the variable for example
#if we want to know the nature of the variable
#we can use the method type(variable) we are going to see this later
#and it will return which value is inside that variable


x2="hello"
#type string

#phyton uses "" to understand what is inside the variable string so if we need to have a string that uses "" to quote we can 
# write \" and the \" will be translated to " when the string is getting read so that phyton can read the whole string


x3="hello \"world\""

print (x3)

#strings can be summed

print(x2 + " " + x3)
