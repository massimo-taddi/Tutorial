//types of variable in js

let a = 1;
let b = "hello world";

const c = "im a constant";

// good to know this is not like c# you need to use template iterals to allow you
// to print and use values of variables inside for example console.log() example

//this console.log functionality allow you to print on the console of your html page when you run the application
//the values you put inside them

console.log(a, b);

//example of template iteral

console.log(
  `this is the value in the variable a  + ${a} and this is the value inside the variable b ${b}`
);
